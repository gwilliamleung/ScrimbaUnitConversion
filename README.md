# ScrimbaUnitConversion

This is the fourth solo project done through Scrimba that reinforces HTML, CSS and Javascript. By entering any valid integer in the box, and pressing the associated button, it will print out values of said number but in the approriate conversion. It reinforces using the DOM by getting numbers from input and changing said HTML correspondingly.
