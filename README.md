# ScrimbaUnitConversion

This is the fourth solo project done through Scrimba that reinforces HTML, CSS and Javascript learning. By entering any valid integer in the box, it will print out said conversions after pressing the associated button. It reinforces using the DOM by getting numbers from input and changing said HTML correspondingly.
